# decent

A Ruby command line application for managing cryptocurrency holdings.

## Synopsis

I like doing things from the command line.  And like any command line user worth their
salt, I **hodl** some cryptocurrencies.  I made `decent` so I can quickly, compulsively
access exchange rates and address balances from my highfalutin terminal.

Currently supports Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Litecoin (LTC).

## Install

`bundle install decent`
